You were never the first choice. 

No chance you were the first pick for this job. 

Nonetheless, crisis makes the proximal into light-bringers.

# Trade Frigate "Sumar" // 15.4.5014u

After a month of cold-storage transit, the squad are thawed out of their cyro, given life once again. Other than restore feeling in the limbs and gaze into infinity from the observation blister, all which could be done was read and reread the puzzlingly light intel package on the assignment ahead. 

1. Co-contractors **LANDMARK COLONIAL (LC)** and **UNION ADMINISTRATOR [REDACTED]** stress that associates deployed on behalf of subcontractor **MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY (MSMC) XXXst DETACHMENT** will make it their prime directive to treat the situation on ground with the utmost care. **UNION ADMINISTRATOR [REDACTED]**, co-signer of the Contract, with ~~acting~~ retired **LC** chairman **AUGUSTUS R.E. VREID**, has provided the subcontractor with confidential intel suggesting **ARDENNES-3, “HERCYNIA** may be populated by a pre-colonial indigenous culture. Evidence is yet inconclusive. 
2. **LC**, subsidiary of **SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO (SSC)**, holds the planetary charter. On landfall, **GROUND TEAM** will proceed to make contact with Landmark administrative staff to order to present their credentials and formally integrate into the local hierarchy.
3. **HERCYNIA** was once subject to a widespread and catastrophic expeditionary campaign in the final epoch of the **SECOND COMMITTEE (SECCOMM)**. Records lack detail, but information gleaned from the old databases of the defunct **UNION COLONIAL MISSION (UCM)** indicate SecComm mounted similar campaigns against resistant populations in numerous theaters in the wake of the **HERCYNIAN CRISIS**. **HERCYNIA**, as a result of this, is host to a massive amounts of radiation, phantom distress signals, encrypted comms, and the “noise” that emanates from the world. Ground Team should expect to encounter old Union military infrastructure in the form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and - potentially - derelict ground-based installations.

# Landfall, Hercynia // 18.4.5014u

Approaching the world, their autoshuttle’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by their superiors. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group appro approaches from the the shuttle. The group introduce themselves as members of the **EVERGREEN MILITIA**. **BRAVA HADURA**, commander of the militia forces, personally leads the welcoming party. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.
