# Evergreen, Hercynia // 11.5.5014u

After some much-needed R&R, Ground Team **WHISKEY-OSCAR-KILO-ECHO** are called to the Council Chambers of the Governor's Farm. With spring on **SOLO TERRA** fast drawing to a close, **PATIENCE** has convened the colonial defense council to review intelligence and discuss strategy for the ongoing defense of **EVERGREEN**. 

After allowing everyone else to speak before them, Patience takes the stand and annouces that they have finalized connection to one of the colony's meteorological satellites. While it will remain primarily a weather satellite, this will allow them to capture static data on the planet's surface. Given the fact that **HERCYNIA** is currently subject to a global monsoon season, the satellite remains in geosynchronous orbit over Evergreen.
