Rawhide was born on some newly colonized planet while their mom was providing medical assistance to a newly established civilization. They couldn't remember the name of it if they tried. The contract their mom had on the planet expired, and the two of them moved onto the next job before they'd even had a chance to open their eyes. Their father was a Lancer before them, so they didn't see him much outside of the very brief communication to their mother he was able to make while out working. 

They spent most of their time as a child hanging around their mom while she worked, or staying on the transport ship to keep out of the way. When they were finally old enough, they eventually even began assisting their mom, learning much about medical care first-hand. On the handful of occasions their father had time between deployments, in which he would spend every day with his child, telling stories from work, helping their mother with her own work, and doing anything he could to make up for lost time. 

Eventually, encouraged by their father's tales of heroics and action, they started on the path to becoming a Lancer themselves. They hadn't had as strict of a military upbringing as their father, but knew that they could still do some good in the galaxy. 

The rest is sort of history.
