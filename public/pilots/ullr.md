Ullr (or "Broadside", as CO Tigris refers to him) has been part of the MSMC for a few years now. Most people don't talk about him, but rather whisper, as not much is known about himâ€¦ and he doesn't announce his arrivals or departures. Aside from being a helluva shot, most people agree that he carries himself like a military man, and it's rumored that he's from a diasporan planet.
