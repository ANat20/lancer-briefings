The unique technology restrictions on his homeworld — New Preta — have seen him imbued with a higher level of creativity and problem solving; though by Union standards his grasp of modern technology is still lacking somewhat. His repair skill is considerable, given his background, though he will occasionally insist upon fixing what could simply be reprinted. He has a tendency to place value strange antiques, which clutter his quarters whereever he happens to stay on deployments. While he has completed the preliminary Union integration courses, he should be employed with some caution. His experiments have the potential to put other personnel at risk (see **Sub-Section 57434760984-B.1**). In addition, New Preta has several antiquated, culturally-ingrained traditions that deviate from MSMC standards. Most are minor, like requiring physical paper for all legally-binding contracts that require his signature. The largest concern, however, lies in his culture's penchant for settling personal conflicts with duels. Current behavioral data does not suggest he will act on said tradition, though intel on what a New Pretan duel entails is incomplete. Pilot has been noted to harbor a strong yearning to return to his homeworld — not uncommon for one separated unwillingly from his people and way of life.
