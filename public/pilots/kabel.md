The unique technology restrictions of his homeworld — New Preta — have seen him adopt an abstract level of creativity and problem solving; though, by Union standards, his grasp on modern technology is still somewhat lacking. His repair skill is considerable, occasionally he will insist on fixing what could simply be reprinted. He has a tendency to place value strange antiques, which clutter his quarters wherever he happens to stay on deployments. 

While he has completed the preliminary Union integration courses, he should be employed with a degree of caution. His experiments have the potential to put other personnel and civilians at risk (see **Sub-Section 57434760984-B.1**). In addition, New Preta has several archaic, culturally-ingrained traditions that deviate from MSMC standards. Most are minor, like requiring physical paper for all legally-binding contracts that warrant his signature. The largest concern, however, lies in his culture's penchant for settling personal conflicts with duels. Current behavioral data does not suggest he will act on said tradition, though intel on what a New Pretan duel entails is incomplete. 

Pilot has been noted to harbor a strong yearning to return to his homeworld — not uncommon for one separated unwillingly from his people and way of life.
