# Mission // #002
## Vigilant Gaze

Patience has placed the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to remain on high alert. Whiskey-Oscar-Kilo-Echo are to remain within Evergreen's walls as milita scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.

# Goals
- Defend Evergreen and its citizenry; safeguard key infrastructure and personnel.

# Reserves
- Check any reserves that the PCs might be bringing with them that they acquired on previous missions or during downtime (e.g., the core batteries they may have acquired
during BEAT 3: BOWL SEASON or goodwill bonuses from R&R DOWN THE WELL).
